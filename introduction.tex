File partitioning is one of the most ubiquitous techniques in HPC and Big Data systems. File partitioning is often a simple technique which for that very reason is often ignore and overlooked moving most of the research focus to more complex components and techniques.
. \\ \\
This thesis questions this assumptions and explores different techniques to make file partitioning a key process for big data processing systems.
\\ \\
Additionally, but not less importantly this thesis presents a Velox File System. A novel distributed file systems part of the Velox Big Data Framework which heavy utilizes heavy optimized file partitioning techniques.
